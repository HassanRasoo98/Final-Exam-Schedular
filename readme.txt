You have to run the app.py file contained in the final exam folder (that is the flask file)

you will need to install the following packages to run this app:
python, pandas, flask, levenshtein
all these packages can be installed simply using Pip other than python.

Incase of problems, suggestions and feedback you can reach out to me at my email: hassanrasool1057@gmail.com
Thank you!

I will try to incorporate this into an API so that in can be hosted on a website.
